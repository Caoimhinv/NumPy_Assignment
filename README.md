## Autumn 2021 Assignment

![NumPy_logo](Images/NumPy_logo.png)

___

This repositry contains the following:
- jupyter notebook - numpy.random.ipynb
- this readme file - README.md
- requirements text file - requirement.txt
- an images folder containing images used in the jupyter notebook
- A PDF file containing the brief and instructions for the assignment - ProgDA_Assignment.pdf
- a gitignore file - .gitignore

---

The notebook can be viewed in github, but most of the images won't render properly. Therefore it is suggested you view a rendered version here - https://nbviewer.org/github/Caoimhinv/NumPy_Assignment/blob/main/numpy.random.ipynb

Alternatively you can download and open the notebook with Jupyter from the command line.
