___

The brief for this assignment was to create a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the package numpy.random, including
detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.
There were four distinct tasks to be carried out in your Jupyter notebook.
1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

This repositry contains the following:
- jupyter notebook - numpy.random.ipynb
- this readme file - README.md
- requirements text file - requirement.txt
- an images folder containing images used in the jupyter notebook
- A PDF file containing the brief and instructions for the assignment - ProgDA_Assignment.pdf
- a gitignore file - .gitignore

---

The notebook can be viewed in github, but most of the images won't render properly. Therefore it is suggested you view a rendered version here - https://nbviewer.org/github/Caoimhinv/NumPy_Assignment/blob/main/numpy.random.ipynb

Alternatively you can download and open the notebook with Jupyter from the command line.
